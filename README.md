# Stanford Daily Tech Workshop Week 1 Assignment (due 10/4)

## Getting started

**If you get stuck at any step, reach out to Holden or Alex and we'll help you out!**

1. If you're on a mac, open up terminal. If you're on a windows machine, open up command prompt.
2. Type (or copy and paste) `git clone https://github.com/ufxela/daily-tech-wksh-asst1.git` into the terminal/command prompt. Press enter.
   1. If you're encountering issues with the command `git clone...` then for now you can click on the green code button, and then click on download zip to download a zip of this folder. Then unzip it on your computer. We'll cover git week 2 so don't worry if git isn't working properly right now.
   2. Or you can try to install git by first installing homebrew (instructions [here](https://brew.sh/)) and then using homebrew to install git (instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac))
   3. You should see something like (may not match exactly)
```
Cloning into 'daily-tech-wksh-asst1'...

```
