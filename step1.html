First time steps:
1. `git clone https://github.com/ufxela/daily-tech-wksh-asst1.git` - this copies the repository onto your computer
2. `git branch [branch name]` - use unique name for your branch (one idea is to do `[your userrname]-dev`). This creates a branch.
3. `git checkout [branch name]` - this "checks out" a branch
4. copy in your progress for asst1
5. `git add -A` - this stages all of your changes
6. `git commit -m "commit message"` - this commits your changes to the repository. Put something descriptive for your commit message.
7. `git push origin [branch name]` - this "pushes" or uploads your code to github. At this point if you go to github, you should be able to select your branch and view your changes online.


After the first time (e.g. submitting assignment 1):
1. no longer have to git clone.
2. no longer need to create a branch
3. may not need to check out branch again
4. don't need to recopy asst1.
5. basically just make changes and do steps 5-7.
